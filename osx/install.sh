# TO DO: install brew formulae from specific versions, but warns about

# TO DO: create hooks at the root directory to run code before/after
  # packages (e.g. for pip install, since it's the same for unix systems)

# TO DO: skip commented formulae on .brew extensions
# TO DO: create a utils script to provide common functions to install scripts
  # e.g. info messages / interaction / log (maybe requirements installation)


# TO DO: create a layer of abstraction to run package management installations
  # e.g. search for .brew.packman files and install requirements list with brew
  # (maybe this can be a new software!)
